# OpenGPU Network ETH Contracts

## Description

The OpenGPU Network ETH Contracts repository contains smart contracts developed for the OpenGPU Network, a blockchain-based decentralized GPU computing platform. Our mission is to revolutionize the cloud computing industry by utilizing idle GPUs from everyday users, providing cost-effective and scalable computing power for AI and other high-performance applications.

## Key Features

- **ORC-20 Token Standard**: An advanced token standard that includes metadata fields like descriptions, logos, and social media links, which are updatable.
- **Staking**: Stake oGPU tokens to earn rewards through our enhanced Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
- **GPU Computing Layer**: Participate as a validator and earn additional income by contributing GPU power to compute-intensive tasks.

## Repository Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contracts for the OpenGPU Network.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for deployment and management of the smart contracts.
- `test/`: Unit tests for the smart contracts.

## Installation

To get started with the development, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGPUNetwork/ETH_Contracts.git
cd ETH_Contracts
npm install
```
